## Review of front- and back-end design

## New multi-region complexity {.smaller}

* Previously, the data provider -> webapp interface was under-specified
    * We weren't always on the same page
    * We often needed to post-process data from providers. Confusing!
* ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  **A specification to the rescue!**
    * Sebastien Lenard and I collaborated on GitHub to establish firm agreements about
      the interface.
    * Decisions and discussions result in specification changes.
    * Guided our development and issue resolution.

## What's new in the GUI?

1. User is greeted by splash-style super-region selector
    * Many more regions to come!
1. Recurse through sub-sub-regions indefinitely
1. UI usability tweaks
    * Plot and map titles now more consistent and complete
    * Legends now motionless and out of the way
    * Darker default basemap
